## 3. HARDWARE SETUP
This section describes the hardware setup required for the demonstration.
Refer ["Motor Control High Voltage 230VAC-1.5kW Development Board User's Guide"](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/MCU16/ProductDocuments/UserGuides/Motor-Control-High-Voltage-230VAC-1.5kW-Dev-Board-Users-Guide-DS70005576.pdf), before operating the unit.
> **Note:** </br>
>In this document, hereinafter the MCHV-230VAC-1.5kW Development Board is referred as **development board**.

1. Ensure the development board is not powered and it is fully discharged. Verify the LEDs **LD1**(Green) and **LD4**(Red) on Power Factor Correction Board and **LD1**(Green) on Motor Control Inverter Board are not glowing. 

     <p align="left" >
     <img  src="images/MCHVnotpowered.png" width="500"></p>

2. Remove the thumb screw and open the top cover of the enclosure and measure the DC Bus voltage across the terminals which reads approximately '0 VDC'. If the voltage is greater than 1V, wait until it is completely discharged.

3. Connect the positive terminal of the bulb load to connector J3 and the negative terminal to connector J8 provided on the development Board.</p>

     <p align="left" >
     <img src="images/loadConnection.PNG" width="500"></p>


4. Insert the **dsPIC33CK64MC105 Motor Control DIM** into the DIM Interface **connector J2** on the development board. Make sure the DIM is placed correctly and oriented before going ahead. Close the top cover of the enclosure and secure it with the thumb screw.

     <p align="left" >
     <img  src="images/dimconnected.jpg" width="500"/></p>

5. Power the PFC board using a controlled AC source by applying a voltage within in the range 150-240V<sub>ac rms</sub> and a frequency of 50Hz through IEC connector **connector J1** provided on the PFC board. If the supply frequency is 60Hz, refer to point No: 3 in the section [Basic Demonstration](#52-basic-demonstration) to change the input frequency in firmware parameters . 

      <p align="left">
      <img  src="images/mchvpower.png" width="500"/></p>

> **Note:** </br>
>The Development Board is designed to operate in the 90 to 230V<sub>ac rms</sub> voltage range with a maximum input current of 10A<sub>rms</sub>. In the Input AC voltage range of 90 to 150V<sub>ac rms</sub>, the maximum input power to the Development Board must be derated (<1500W) to maintain the input current through the socket to less than or equal to 10A<sub>rms</sub>.

6. The Development Board has an on-board programming tool called the Isolated PKoB4 Daughter Board. To use the on-board programmer, connect a micro-USB cable between the Host PC and connector J11(**PROGRAM**) on the development board.
      <p align="left">
      <img  src="images/mchvProgrammer.JPG" width="500"/></p>
> **Note:** </br>
> Use only **shielded micro-USB** cables intended for data transfer.

 7. To establish serial communication with the host PC, connect a micro-USB cable between the host PC and connector J8(**USB-UART**) on the development board. 
      <p align="left">
      <img  src="images/usbUart.JPG" width="500"/></p>
 
 </br>

## 4. SOFTWARE SETUP AND RUN
### 4.1 Setup: MPLAB X IDE and MPLAB XC-DSC Compiler
Install **MPLAB X IDE** and **MPLAB XC-DSC Compiler** versions that support the device **dsPIC33CK64MC105** and **PKOBv4.** The MPLAB X IDE, MPLAB XC-DSC Compiler, and X2C-Scope plug-in used for testing the firmware are mentioned in the [PFC Application Firmware Required for the Demonstration](#21-pfc-application-firmware-required-for-the-demonstration) section. 

To get help on  

- MPLAB X IDE installation, refer [link](https://microchipdeveloper.com/mplabx:installation)
- MPLAB XC-DSC Compiler installation steps, refer [link](https://developerhelp.microchip.com/xwiki/bin/view/software-tools/xc-dsc/install/)

If MPLAB IDE v8 or earlier is already installed on your computer, then run the MPLAB driver switcher (Installed when MPLAB®X IDE is installed) to switch from MPLAB IDE v8 drivers to MPLAB X IDE drivers. If you have Windows 8 or 10, you must run the MPLAB driver switcher in **Administrator Mode**. To run the Device Driver Switcher GUI application as administrator, right-click on the executable (or desktop icon) and select **Run as Administrator**. For more details, refer to the MPLAB X IDE help topic **“Before You Begin: Install the USB Device Drivers (For Hardware Tools): USB Driver Installation for Windows Operating Systems.”**

### 4.2 Setup: X2C-SCOPE
X2C-Scope is a MPLAB X IDE plugin that allows developers to interact with an application while it runs. X2C-Scope enables you to read, write, and plot global variables (for motor control) in real-time. It communicates with the target using the UART. To use X2C-Scope, the plugin must be installed. To set up and use X2C-Scope, refer to the instructions provided on the [web page](https://x2cscope.github.io/docs/MPLABX_Plugin.html).

## 5.3  Data visualization through X2C-Scope Plug-in of MPLAB X

X2C-Scope is a third-party plug-in in MPLAB X, which helps in real-time diagnostics. The application firmware comes with the initialization needed to interface the controller with the host PC to enable data visualization through the X2C-Scope plug-in. Ensure the X2C-Scope plug-in is installed. For more information on how to set up a plug-in, refer to either the [Microchip Developer Help page](https://microchipdeveloper.com/mplabx:tools-plugins-available) or the [web page.](https://x2cscope.github.io/docs/MPLABX_Plugin.html)
 
1. To establish serial communication with the host PC, connect a micro-USB cable between the host PC and connector J8 **(USB-UART)** on the development board. This interface provides an isolated USB-UART communication.

2. Ensure the application is configured and running as described under section [5.2 Basic Demonstration](#52-basic-demonstration) by following steps 1 through 8.

3. Open the **X2C-Scope** window by selecting **Tools>Embedded>X2CScope.**
     <p align="left">
     <img  src="images/x2cselection.PNG"></p>

4. **In the X2C-Scope Configuration** window, open the **Connection Setup** tab and click **Select Project.** This opens the drop-down menu **Select Project** with a list of opened projects. Select the specific project **pfc** from the list of projects and click **OK**.    
    <p align="left">
    <img  src="images/x2cprojectselection.PNG"></p>

5. To configure and establish the serial communication for **X2C-Scope**, open the **X2CScope Configuration** window, click on the **Connection Setup** tab and:
     - Set **Baudrate** as **115200**, which is configured in the application firmware. 
     - Click on the **Refresh** button to refresh and update the list of the available Serial COM ports connected to the Host PC. 
     - Select the specific **Serial port** detected when interfaced with the development board. The **Serial port** depends on the system settings
          <p align="left">
          <img  src="images/x2cconnectionsetup.PNG"></p>
 
6. Once the **Serial port** is detected, click on **Disconnected** and turn to **Connected**, to establish serial communication between the Host PC and the board.
     <p align="left">
     <img  src="images/x2cconnectionbutton.PNG"></p>


7. Open the **Project Setup** tab in the **X2CScope Configuration** window and,
     - Set **Scope Sampletime** as the interval at which <code>X2CScopeUpdate()</code> is called. In this application, it is every <code>50µs.</code> 
     - Then, click **Set Values** to save the configuration.
          <p align="left">
          <img  src="images/x2cprojectsetup.PNG"></p>


8. Click on **Open Scope View** (in the **Data Views** tab of the **X2CScope Configuration** Window) this opens **Scope Window.**
     <p align="left">
     <img  src="images/x2cdataview.PNG"></p>
    	     
9. In the **Scope Window**, select the variables that must be watched. To do this, click on the **Source** against each channel, and a window **Select Variables** opens on the screen. From the available list, the required variable can be chosen. Ensure checkboxes **Enable** and **Visible** are checked for the variables to be plotted.
To view data plots continuously, uncheck **Single-shot.** When **Single-shot** is checked, it captures the data once and stops. The **Sample time factor** value multiplied by **Sample time** decides the time difference between any two consecutive data points on the plot.
    <p align="left">
    <img  src="images/x2cdatapointselection.PNG" width="700"></p>

10.	Click on **SAMPLE**, then the X2C-Scope window plots variables in real-time, which updates automatically.
     <p align="left">
     <img  src="images/x2csample.PNG" width="700"></p>
